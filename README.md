it is about connecting ChatGPT with your custom scripts to achieve things you never thought about with traditional ChatGPT, even with GPT-4 or ChatGPT Plus.

So what I did simply, is I created a prototype using 3 python functions, that allowed me to:

Read Live Bitcoin Price and Analyze it, it is like technical analysis with ChatGPT.
Search Google and Get the Latest Top Search Results and Summarize it with ChatGPT.
Generate Images Using an Advanced Prompt with the Help of OpenAI API.
And to run this project with a clean simple UI, I used Streamlit, which is an awesome library that allows you to build a web interface for any tool in seconds.
